-Artful Dodgers-

This app is a basic store front outline for a second hand clothes store
called Artful Dodgers.

The app features a landing page, Navigation bar (present on all pages and static), a product page,
Login and registeration pages and a cart page.

-The landing page gives a breif discription of the store
-the navbar features links to all our other pages, it will also display the logged in user name
-the Login and register pages features forms and validation checks for user inputs
-the cart page displays any products added from the store page in the cart, the user
 can also choose a shipping method and view info about each shipping method
 the users total cart and shipping costs are combined to give a grand total for the user


 -Tools-
 This app makes use of:
 -React Redux
 -React Bootstrap
 -React Formik and yup

 -Other notes-

 The registration and login are examples of form use, state use and validation
 they do not actually update any lists of users, you are not required to register
 before logging in. instead Logging in will simply set the state that shows the 
 username in the navbar.
